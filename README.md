# Go-to-Market Framework

This is a basic framework I’ve used across platform and SaaS launches. It’s meant to be lightweight, flexible, and usable by product, marketing, and sales teams working together.

The goal is to create shared understanding about who the product is for, how it’s positioned, what problems it solves, and how it will reach the right users.

## Why It’s Here

Most GTM templates are built for slide decks. This is structured more like a product artifact—so it can live close to where product and engineering work already happens.
